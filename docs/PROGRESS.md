# Implementation progress

This is the running record of how far the code has moved through the
[F01–F262 spec catalog](specs/README.md). It is updated in every PR that changes behaviour.
The specs say what to build. This file says what has been built, what is verified, and what
is not yet started.

Status legend: ✅ shipped and covered by tests · 🟡 partly shipped (the gap is named) ·
⬜ not started. "Shipped" means merged to `main` and passing CI. It does **not** mean
production-ready. Per `AGENTS.md`, that also needs real-provider end-to-end validation, a
tenant-isolation and secret-handling review, and a rollback rehearsal. None of those has
happened yet.

## Delivery slices

Work ships as vertical slices in dependency order (see
[`specs/00-current-state.md` §4](specs/00-current-state.md#4-distance-to-a-launchable-v1)).
Each slice is one PR. A PR is merged only once CI passes.

| # | Slice | Specs | Defects | State | PR |

| 1 | Inbound tenant resolution from verified GitHub installation; multi-workspace membership | F15, F25 (expand), F59 | D2 (expand), D3, N6 (inbound) | ✅ | #6 |
| 2 | Worker modularisation, envelope encryption with AAD and key version, queue messages carry ids not secrets | F33–F40 | D5, D6 | ⬜ | — |
| 3 | Tenant-scoped integrations API with write-time validation; GitHub App install flow; `organization_id` NOT NULL contract | F26–F29, F56–F58, F72 | D2 (contract), D9, D12, D16, N6 | ⬜ | — |

AI features (F243–F262) stay out of scope until the delivery ledger is trustworthy. See

## Slice 1 — inbound tenant resolution (PR #6)

**What changed**

- `migrations/0006_multi_org_and_tenant_scoping.sql`
  - Drops `member_one_org_per_user`, the index that actually blocked a second workspace.
  - Adds `member_user_org_unique`, so a user still cannot hold two memberships in the *same*
    workspace.
  - Adds a nullable, indexed `organization_id` to `integrations`, `deliveries` and
    `notification_outbox`. This is the expand phase.
  - Adds `github_installations`, unique per `(installation_id, app_id)`, with
    `ON DELETE CASCADE` to `organization`.
- `src/index.ts`
  - `readInstallationBlock()` is the pure parser. It requires a positive safe-integer
    `installation.id` and rejects any `app_id` that is present but is not our App's.
  - `resolveTenant()` looks up the installation scoped to `GITHUB_APP_ID`. An unknown, foreign,
    missing, suspended or uninstalled installation returns `403`. There is no fallback.
  - Integration lookup is now `WHERE organization_id=? AND repo=?`. `organization_id` is
    written to both the delivery row and the outbox row in one D1 batch.
- `GITHUB_APP_ID` is a declared var. It ships as a placeholder, which makes ingress fail
  closed until a real App is configured.

**Verified by**

- `tests/tenant-resolution.test.ts`: 9 cases. They cover a missing block, a non-object block,
  a non-integer, string, negative or zero id, a foreign App, a non-numeric `app_id`, an absent
  `app_id`, and a guarantee that a `repository` field never resolves a tenant.
- `scripts/test_auth_schema.py`: cross-workspace membership is allowed, a duplicate
  membership in the same workspace is rejected, and one installation cannot be claimed by two
  workspaces.

**Known gaps, carried to slice 3**

- No install flow writes `github_installations` yet, so production ingress returns `403` for
  every event. This is intentional: it fails closed.
- Existing `integrations` rows have `organization_id = NULL`, so nothing routes to them. They
  need a backfill before the NOT NULL contract migration.
- The queue consumer does not yet re-check `organization_id` against the integration. That
  arrives with slice 2, when messages carry ids instead of ciphertext.
